Lets talk about DP (*_*: ) :
dp is nothing but used to reduce the no. of steps to calculate a solution rather it gets 
from previous solution , if we see when we do the fabinocci series the 

current sol is obtained by previos solutions
current slution = sum of prev_two_solutions

rather calculating the entire , we just need to store the things!

We dont need to perform the dp for factorial .

But these two examples are very easy ,we can solve efficiently without using the dp .

--? Real concept of dp bro! ?--
intrested ! coutinue 

dp is choosing state and transitions

state means the current state , transition means changes the current state (it can be by previous solution or current)
